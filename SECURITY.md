To help us assess and reproduce the issue as quickly as possible, please provide:
  1. **Summary**: A brief description of the problem.
  2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Precise, ordered steps (including URLs, payloads, etc.).
  3. **Impact Assessment**: What an attacker could achieve (data loss, escalation, etc.).
  4. **Proof of Concept**: Screenshots, code snippets, or test scripts.
  5. **Environment Details**: Browser, OS, app version, or API endpoint.

### 3. Acknowledgment & Update Timeline
**Acknowledgment**: You will receive confirmation of receipt within 3 business days.

Status Updates:
- **Weekly**: We will send you a brief update on our progress.

If you do not hear from us at any point, feel free to send a polite follow-up to the same channel.

### 4. What to Expect After Triage
- **Accepted Vulnerabilities**
  - Fix Plan: We will share an estimated timeline for a fix.
  - Patch Release: Once deployed, we will notify you and—if you wish—credit you in our security advisory.

- **Rejected Reports**
  - Explanation: You will receive a clear rationale (e.g., not reproducible, out of scope, low risk).
  - Further Clarification: If you believe the issue was misunderstood, we welcome additional information.

### 5. Confidentiality & Safe Harbor

You will not face legal action for good-faith security research in accordance with our Safe Harbor Policy.
